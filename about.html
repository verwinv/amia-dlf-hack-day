          <h2>What will be the format of the event?</h2>
          <p>In advance of the hack day, project ideas will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. On the morning of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, selecting an idea to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.</p>
          <p>Projects will be presented during the conference closing plenary, Saturday November 9 at 8:30am. Projects will be judged by a panel as well as by conference attendees.</p>
          <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
          <p>Sign up! As this will be a highly participatory event, registration is limited to those willing to get their hands dirty, so no onlookers please.</p>
          <p>If you are unsure whether you can or want to participate in the hack day itself, you can still see the results by attending the AMIA closing plenary, where hack day projects will be presented, and the audience will have an opportunity to vote on their favorites.</p>
          <h2>Ready to sign up and join the fun?</h2>
          <p>REGISTER HERE. It’s free.  You can also register when you register for the Conference.
          </p>
          <h2>Why an AMIA hack day?</h2>
          <p>An audiovisual preservation-themed CURATEcamp was held in April 2013, drawing over 120 registrants from at least 3 continents for a day of great conversations and lightning talks. CURATEcamp is as series of unconference-style events focused on connecting practitioners and technologists interested in digital curation. The event generated a lot of documentation and articulated many shared concerns. Topics covered included digitization of video, film scanning, digital storage strategies, proprietary digital video files in collections, and technical metadata for preservation. The participants of the event agreed that more work needed to be done and action taken, so the idea for an AMIA hack day was born.</p>
          <h2>What if I’m not a developer/technologist/engineer?</h2>
          <p>Content managers and preservation practitioners will be as central to the success of the event as keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.</p>
